# Shroty

Sorry. It was a typo. Should've been shorty (<- see, I can type!).
That's how things start. Anyway.

It all started as an experiment to use SPDY and Go in one project.
A shortener is pretty easy, so why not 
([and others did it, too](https://github.com/fs111/kurz.go)).

## Setup

1. `go get code.google.com/p/gorilla/mux`
1. `go build`
1. `./shroty -http :6666`

Sometimes later, you might also need:

1. `go get github.com/simonz05/godis`

## License

Do what you want with it. I don't care.
